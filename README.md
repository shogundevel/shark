# Shark Programming Language

Welcome to the Shark programming language! Shark is a language designed to provide the speed and size of Lua, while also offering the familiar syntax of Python. 

The ability to run in the browser is a plus, made possible by shark's self-hosted compiler.

Overall, Shark is a very versatile language that can be used to build web/desktop/mobile applications, multi-platform games (Write once, run anywhere!), servers, command line tools and more.

## Features

* **Fast and lightweight** virtual machine written in C
* Small package size (50 KB) with minimal dependencies
* Can be used in **the browser** and compiled to portable JavaScript/ActionScript/ECMAScript code
* Includes a tiny and portable 2D game framework for small scale game development
* Backwards compatible with Python and Lua libraries and environments by means of targeting them as compilation output
* Official And Builtin Java Virtual Machine implementation

## Getting Started

To get started with Shark, read the Shark Handbook in this repo to learn the basics of Shark programming. Then, read the **guide** file for instructions on using the Shark toolchain to start writing Shark code.

This version of Shark is considered stable (green), and major changes will only be made through the Shark Community Process (SCP) proposals.

This repository contains the Shark SDK binaries and the full source code for these binaries. To start using Shark, download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it to your preferred directory.

If you need further help with Shark or want to start contributing, use github's builtin Discussions or visit the sharkhosted forum at <a href="https://sharkhosted.proboards.com">sharkhosted.proboards.com</a>.
