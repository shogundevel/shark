# Shark Programming Language

Welcome to the Shark programming language! Shark is a new programming language designed to provide the speed and size benefits of Lua, while also offering the familiar syntax of Python. 

With the ability to run in the browser, Shark is a versatile language that can be used to build web applications, games, and more.

## Features

* **Fast and lightweight** virtual machine written in C
* Small package size (50 KB) with minimal dependencies
* Can be used in **the browser** and compiled to portable JavaScript code
* Includes a tiny 2D game framework for small scale game development
* Backwards compatible with Python and Lua environments by means of targeting them as compilation output
* Official Java Virtual Machine implementation available

## Getting Started

To get started with Shark, read the Shark Handbook in this repo to learn the basics of Shark programming. Then, refer to the **guide** file for instructions on downloading and using the Shark tools to start writing Shark code.

Note that this version of Shark is considered stable (green), and major changes will only be made through the Shark Community Process (SCP) proposal process.

This repository contains the Shark SDK binaries and the full source code for these binaries. To start using Shark, download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it to your preferred directory.

If you need further help with Shark or want to start contributing, use github's builtin discussions or visit the sharkhosted forum at <a href="https://sharkhosted.proboards.com">sharkhosted.proboards.com</a>.
